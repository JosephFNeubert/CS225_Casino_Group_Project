# CS225_Casino_Group_Project
This is a group project for CS225 by Connor Shackleford and Joseph Neubert. The project simulates a casino where a user can be created, gamble fake money, and then save their information, name and balance, playing to an external text file for future use. The games are blackjack, roulette, and a slot machine.
